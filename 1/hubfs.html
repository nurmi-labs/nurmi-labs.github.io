<br>
<br>
NAME<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hub, hubfs, hubshell&nbsp; - persistent
multiplexed i/o sessions, or 'screen<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;without a screen'<br>
<br>
SYNOPSIS<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hub [ -b ] [ -t ] [ srvname ] [ hubgroup
]<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hubshell attachstring<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hubfs [ -Dtasm ] srvname<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hub invokes hubfs(1) to create a 9p
filesystem of pipe-like Hubs avail-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;able&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; /srv&nbsp;
and&nbsp; starts an rc(1) shell with its file descriptors<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;redirected to these hubs, then uses
hubshell(1) as a client&nbsp; for &nbsp;these<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;connections.&nbsp; The overall usage
model is somewhat similar to GNU screen<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but without the additional complexities
of TTY management.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The base behavior of hub(1) srvname is
bimodal, and&nbsp; will&nbsp; function&nbsp; as<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;either&nbsp; a client or server
depending on whether /srv/srvname exists. If<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no name is provided,&nbsp; hub&nbsp;
will&nbsp; create&nbsp; or&nbsp; attach&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp;
/srv&nbsp; named<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/srv/hubfs&nbsp; containing&nbsp;
a&nbsp; persistent rc(1) session. Thus, the simplest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;possible model of use is:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to start a hubfs hosted persistent rc(1)
shell. Another invocation of<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from any window with access to that /srv
will connect&nbsp; to&nbsp; it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; -b<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;flag&nbsp; to hub backgrounds the
initially created rc(1) instead of attach-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ing to it. The -t flag starts the
hubfs&nbsp; in&nbsp; trunc&nbsp; mode,&nbsp; which&nbsp; means<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;clients will not be sent the previously
buffered data upon connection.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hubfs&nbsp; can be used to provide
general purpose pipes locally or across a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;network, with some special features.
Most notably,&nbsp; echoing&nbsp; freeze&nbsp; to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the&nbsp; ctl&nbsp; file will change the
behavior of the hub files from pipe-like<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with blocking reads to simple
static&nbsp; files&nbsp; that&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; viewed&nbsp;
and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;edited&nbsp; with&nbsp; normal&nbsp;
tools. Writing melt to ctl will restore pipe-like<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;behavior and resume the normal flow of
data.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While connected via a hubshell input
beginning with a %symbol&nbsp; will&nbsp; be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;checked for matching command strings.
These commands are used to create<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;new subshells within the hubfs session
and move between&nbsp; them.&nbsp; A&nbsp; dis-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tinctive&nbsp; feature&nbsp; is&nbsp;
the&nbsp; ability for remote clients to share a local<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shell with other clients of the hubfs.
The&nbsp; %local&nbsp; NAME&nbsp; command&nbsp; does<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;this.&nbsp; The&nbsp; more&nbsp;
traditional mode of starting new shells on the remote<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;host is done with the %remote NAME
command. Note that 'remote'&nbsp; is&nbsp; the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;machine&nbsp; hosting&nbsp; the&nbsp;
shell&nbsp; you&nbsp; are&nbsp; connected to currently, and the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;active hubs must be running a shell, not
another application.&nbsp; %detach<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;terminates&nbsp; the&nbsp;
hubshell&nbsp; and&nbsp; returns&nbsp; control to the user's
original<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shell.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hub wrapper script:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;start and connect to a new hubfs and
post /srv/aug5<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub aug5<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;connects a new client to the rc shell
started by the previous command<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub aug5<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;start and connects to new rc named rctwo
within the aug5 hubfs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub aug5 rctwo<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Making new shells and moving in
hubshell:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-all commands begin with '%' as first
character-<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %detach&nbsp; #
disconnect from attached shell<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %remote NAME #
start shell on remote machine<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %local NAME #
start shell on local machine shared to hubfs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %attach NAME #
move to an existing hubfs shell<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %err TIME, %in
TIME, %out TIME # time in ms for delay loop<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %status # basic
hubfs connection info<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %list # lc of
connected hubfs hubs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %fear # paranoid
mode, %calm to return to normal operation<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %trunc # don't
send buffered data, %notrunc reactivates<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %unecho # turn off
echo flush, %echoes to reactivate<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; %fortun # turn on
fortune flush, %unfort to deactivate<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Controlling hubfs via the ctl file
(reading from ctl file returns&nbsp; sta-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tus):<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo eof
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # send eof to all readers on all hubs<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo eof NAME
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # send eof to the named hub<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo freeze
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # freeze Hubs as static files<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo melt
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # resume normal flow of data<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo fear
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # paranoid, writers wait for readers<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo calm
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # resume non-paranoid mode<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo trunc
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # don't send buffered data<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo notrunc
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # send buffer to new clients<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo quit
&gt;/n/hubfs/ctl # kill the fs<br>

BUGS<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the standard mode of use for
interactive rc shells, the synchroniza-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tion between stdout and&nbsp;
stderr&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; maintained.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
symptom&nbsp; is<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prompts&nbsp; appearing&nbsp; in&nbsp;
seemingly the wrong place. To fix this, enter a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;command like %err 300 to set 300
milliseconds of delay before data from<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stderr is printed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because&nbsp; hubfs&nbsp;
maintains&nbsp; static&nbsp; buffers and always allows clients
to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;write to avoid loss of interactivity,
slow readers may experience&nbsp; data<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;loss&nbsp; while reading output larger
than the size of the static buffer if<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the output was also transmitted fast
enough to "wrap around" the&nbsp; loca-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the reader in the
data buffer. The purpose of "paranoid" mode<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is to restrict the speed of writers if
this is a concern.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hubs must be given alphabetic names
within the ascii subset of unicode.<br>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Doug had for years and years, and he
talked to&nbsp; us&nbsp; continually&nbsp; about<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it,&nbsp; a&nbsp; notion&nbsp; of
interconnecting computers in grids, and arrays, very<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;complex, and there were always problems
in his proposals. That what you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;would type would be linear and what he
wanted was three-dimensional, n-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dimensional...I mean he wanted just
topological connection of&nbsp; programs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; to&nbsp; build&nbsp;
programs&nbsp; with loops and and horrid things. He had such<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;grandiose ideas and we were saying,
the&nbsp; complexity&nbsp; you're&nbsp; generating<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;just&nbsp; can't&nbsp; be&nbsp;
fathomed.&nbsp; You don't sit down and you don't type these<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kind of connections together. And he
persisted with the grandiose ideas<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;where you get into Kirchoff's law
problems...what happens if you have a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;feedback loop and every program doubles
the number&nbsp; of&nbsp; characters,&nbsp; it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reads&nbsp; one and writes two? It's got
to go somewhere - synchronization -<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there's just no way to implement his
ideas and we kept trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; pare<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;him&nbsp; down&nbsp; and&nbsp;
weed&nbsp; him down and get something useful and distill it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What was needed, was real ideas...and
there were&nbsp; constant&nbsp; discussions<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all&nbsp; through&nbsp; this&nbsp;
period, and it hit just one night, it just hit, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they went in instantly."<br>
