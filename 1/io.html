DESCRIPTION<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Io invokes iosrv(1) to create a system
of pipe(3) devices available&nbsp; as<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a &nbsp;srvfs(4)&nbsp; and&nbsp; starts
an rc(1) shell with its file descriptors redi-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;rected to these pipes, then uses
ioshell(1) as a client for these&nbsp; con-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nections. The overall usage model is
somewhat similar to GNU screen but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;without the additional complexities of
TTY management.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The base behavior of io(1) srvname is
bimodal,&nbsp; and&nbsp; will&nbsp; function&nbsp; as<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;either&nbsp; a client or server
depending on whether /srv/srvname exists. If<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;no name is&nbsp; provided,&nbsp;
io&nbsp; will&nbsp; create&nbsp; or&nbsp; attach&nbsp; to&nbsp;
a&nbsp; /srv&nbsp; named<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/srv/iorc.$pid&nbsp; containing&nbsp; a
persistent rc session. Thus, the simplest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;possible model of use is:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to start a backgrounded iosrv hosted
persistent rc shell, and then<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from any window with access to that /srv
to connect to it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By default, no connection is made to the
initially created rc.&nbsp; The&nbsp; -a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;flag&nbsp; will&nbsp; connect&nbsp; the
calling window to the rc by simply invoking io<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;srvname after it has completed the iosrv
/srv setup. Conversely, if the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-i&nbsp; flag&nbsp; is&nbsp;
given,&nbsp; the&nbsp; initial&nbsp; window is run with the iosrv
server<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;itself foregrounded in interactive
control console mode,&nbsp; with&nbsp; logging<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sent&nbsp; to the initiating window and
that window's keyboard input sent to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the ctl/data file. Otherwise, the output
is&nbsp; backgrounded&nbsp; and&nbsp; control<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;messages&nbsp; can&nbsp; only&nbsp;
be&nbsp; written via echo to the mounted ctl/data pipe.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The -v option activates verbose debug
logging of&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; client&nbsp; and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;server message passing, and -l logfile
redirects logging information in<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;either mode to the specified file, or to
/tmp/iolog$pid if no&nbsp; filename<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is given.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The -p flag is used to start in
'paranoid' mode. Normally, reading pro-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cesses may fill the buffers (sized
to&nbsp; 512k&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; default&nbsp; compile)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ahead&nbsp; of&nbsp; the output clients,
who catch up 'as fast as they are able'.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Paranoid mode enforces a 'one read one
write' behavior. This is&nbsp; gener-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ally not desirable unless a slow client
needs to request well over 512k<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;data at once at maximum speed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The -c command option replaces the
default&nbsp; backgrounded&nbsp; rc&nbsp; with&nbsp; the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;command of your choice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io -c cat
io.cat<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will make cat(1) the active process.
Subsequent commands of the form io<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;io.cat will connect to the running
backgrounded cat&nbsp; process,&nbsp; allowing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for a very simple chat-type application
between multiple users. ( chmod<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;666 /srv/cat.io by the controlling user
will be necessary&nbsp; first.)&nbsp; For<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;more&nbsp; complex&nbsp; commands a
certain amount of ingenuity in string quoting<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;may be required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;io in its client role accepts no flags.
When&nbsp; /srv/srvname&nbsp; exists,&nbsp; io<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;srvname&nbsp; will&nbsp; mount the /srv
and then start an ioshell client attached<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to a new set of file descriptors
requested from&nbsp; the&nbsp; iosrv. &nbsp; Multiple<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;clients&nbsp; may&nbsp; connect&nbsp;
simultaneously,&nbsp; and&nbsp; clients may disconnect and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reconnect freely. The optional arguments
[ zap fast&nbsp; slow&nbsp; here&nbsp; ]&nbsp; are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;translated&nbsp; into&nbsp;
commands&nbsp; sent to the iosrv ctl file.&nbsp; zap clears the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;log prior to connecting.&nbsp; slow and
fast set the basic loop speed of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;server&nbsp; processes.&nbsp;
(Processes&nbsp; lock or block during idle, so this does<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not affect load, only maximum&nbsp;
throughput&nbsp; and&nbsp; consumption&nbsp; of&nbsp; system<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resources&nbsp; during&nbsp;
constant&nbsp; i/o&nbsp; transmission.)&nbsp; here creates an
addi-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tional rc on the CLIENT machine&nbsp;
attached&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; current&nbsp; iosrv&nbsp; and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;attaches&nbsp; to it. In other words,
this allows the client to share a per-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sistent rc session back to the HOST
iosrv and its&nbsp; other&nbsp; clients. &nbsp; An<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;arbitrarily compiled-in maximum of 64
file descriptors can be used pro-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;gressively for a single hub.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ioshell client provides a few
features to interface with iosrv.&nbsp; It<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is&nbsp; invoked automatically by io and
rarely directly by the user. Funda-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mentally, ioshell simply acts to&nbsp;
"bucket&nbsp; brigade"&nbsp; data&nbsp; between&nbsp; the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;user's&nbsp; existing shell file
descriptors and the pipes managed by iosrv.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ioshell is basically
transparent&nbsp; to&nbsp; input&nbsp; and&nbsp; output&nbsp;
with&nbsp; the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;exception of providing a set of commands
and a communication channel to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the iosrv.&nbsp; Some text strings are
intercepted by the ioshell and&nbsp; trig-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ger&nbsp; special&nbsp; actions.&nbsp;
In&nbsp; particular: remote # , local # , attach # ,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;clear , detach , hist , and hub
cmdstring are treated as follows.&nbsp; Note<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that the connection context is relevant
in particular for:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; remote #<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;which creates a new rc session on the
HOST machine (the machine running<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the iosrv being targeted) with 3 new
Hubs activated and shifts the con-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nection&nbsp; to &nbsp;it.&nbsp; #
corresponds to the lowest numbered of the new Hubs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This command can only be issued when
actually connected to an&nbsp; io&nbsp; ses-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sion on the remote host. (This
corresponds to the conventional creation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of a new shell within 'screen'.)
Conversely,<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; local #<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;functions similarly but the rc is hosted
by&nbsp; the&nbsp; CLIENT&nbsp; machine&nbsp; (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;machine&nbsp; importing&nbsp; the /srv -
if both the client and the server are on<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the same machine, remote and local
are&nbsp; equivalent.)&nbsp; Multiple&nbsp; clients<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;can all share rc sessions to the other
clients via the shared iosrv. In<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;other words, starting new shared
rc's&nbsp; using&nbsp; the&nbsp; local&nbsp; option&nbsp; makes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iosrv the equivalent of a shared /srv
for the connected machines, where<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;any machine can post new pipes for
either input or&nbsp; output.&nbsp; Note&nbsp; that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;local will always refer to the local
client machine, but the meaning of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'remote' shifts depending on where the
current ioshell is attached.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attach #<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shifts to the currently existing iosrv
rc whose lowest Hub # is&nbsp; given.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Using&nbsp; new&nbsp; and&nbsp; attach,
the user can create additional instances of rc<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;connected to the current iosrv and
switch&nbsp; between&nbsp; them&nbsp; freely.&nbsp; VERY<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IMPORTANT:&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp;
standard&nbsp; rc&nbsp; shell&nbsp; or&nbsp; other&nbsp;
traditional&nbsp; textual<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;input/output program uses 3 file
descriptors, numbering should&nbsp; proceed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;by&nbsp; increments of 3 as additonal rc
are attached to a given iosrv host.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some care must be taken to track these
numbers as the results&nbsp; of&nbsp; mis-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;aligned&nbsp; attaches&nbsp; could be
disruptive to the integrity of the session.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The simple rule is that the numeric
parameter to&nbsp; the&nbsp; attach,&nbsp; remote,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and local commands should always be a
multiple of 3.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; detach<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ends&nbsp; the&nbsp; current&nbsp;
ioshell attachment to the iosrv pipes - it does not<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;affect the remote system in any way, it
simply returns control&nbsp; to&nbsp; the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;original&nbsp; shell. (it also requests
a fortune(1) on the way out.)&nbsp; clear<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resets the internal buffers and pointers
of the&nbsp; primary&nbsp; set&nbsp; of&nbsp; hubs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(H0,&nbsp; H1,&nbsp; and&nbsp; H2).
&nbsp; hist&nbsp; provides&nbsp; a&nbsp; command history of the
user's<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;attached ioshell.&nbsp; Note this is not
a&nbsp; complete&nbsp; log&nbsp; of&nbsp; all&nbsp; attached<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;input&nbsp; clients, but only of the
local client.&nbsp; hub cmdstring sends cmd-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;string to the iosrv ctl file, enabling
arbitrary commands to be&nbsp; passed<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to&nbsp; the&nbsp; session. Notable
commands include: hub fear to active paranoid<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mode and hub calm to deactivate
it.&nbsp; hub&nbsp; quit&nbsp; terminates&nbsp; the&nbsp;
entire<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iosrv&nbsp; and&nbsp; kills&nbsp;
all&nbsp; reader and writer processes.&nbsp; hub debug and hub<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shutup act to start and stop verbose
debug output respectively.&nbsp; (Note:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the&nbsp; logging&nbsp; information is
not sent to the ioshell client, but rather<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to the location specified by the initial
io server command.).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The low level hub commands are also
supported. Each hub command&nbsp; begins<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;with&nbsp; the&nbsp; letter&nbsp; 'h',
is followed by a numeric Hub identifier, then a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;single letter representing a&nbsp;
verb,&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; usually&nbsp; an&nbsp;
additional<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;numeric&nbsp; parameter. The io and
ioshell tools use these commands to per-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;form their actions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h1t50<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from within an attached ioshell sets the
sleeptime parameter of&nbsp; Hub&nbsp; 1<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to&nbsp; 50&nbsp; ms, which will occur
twice per read cycle and at least once per<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;write cycle. See the examples section
and source code for more details.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Verbs&nbsp; are: &nbsp; t: time, c:
clear, s: start, o: output. e: err, i: input,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;f: freefd, k: killfd x: xit, v: view, y:
kill rdproc, z:&nbsp; kill&nbsp; wrproc.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All&nbsp; commands&nbsp; except&nbsp; c,
x, and v take a 4th numeric parameter. Due to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ongoing development, a full
specification of the 'h%d%c%d' Hub commands<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will not be offered in this manpage.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp; iosrv&nbsp; command&nbsp;
is&nbsp; usually called from the io wrapper script. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;options that vary from those of the
wrapper script are&nbsp; mostly&nbsp; experi-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;mental debugging options. The -dhrs
flags deactivate the default setup,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;turn off file descriptor preservation,
turn off ramfs(4) and prevent&nbsp; a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/srv&nbsp; from&nbsp; being&nbsp;
posted,&nbsp; respectively.&nbsp; Check&nbsp; the&nbsp;
source&nbsp; code for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;details.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In theory, there is nothing preventing
the iosrv&nbsp; pipes&nbsp; from&nbsp; carrying<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;any&nbsp; kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; data. A
small amount of testing of remote control of GUI<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;apps indicates this is a fruitful area
for experimentation, and in the-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ory&nbsp; multiple iosrv can be
connected to create pipe topologies of arbi-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;trary complexity involving multiple
machines with the ability&nbsp; to&nbsp; con-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nect and disconnect clients in real
time.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For&nbsp; most users and purposes, io
srvname used to both start and connect<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to a given /srv (in combination with any
needed network&nbsp; imports)&nbsp; will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;be the primary mode of usage, along with
remote # and attach # commands<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from within the attached ioshells. The
concluding example of a manually<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;created set of connections is provided
to demonstrate additional possi-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bilities for further development of the
underlying iosrv core.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Start a session named aug1 and connect
to it in the same window&nbsp; as&nbsp; it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;was launched:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io -a aug1<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Connect a second client to that
session:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io aug1<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Start another session named rc.2
backgrounded but with non-verbose log-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ging written to the default logfile:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (host) io -l
rc.2<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Connect to that rc session from a remote
client. First, import the host<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;machine's /srv then connect and also
clear the backscroll:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client) import
-ac HOST /srv<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client) io rc.2
zap<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From &nbsp;within&nbsp; that&nbsp; rc,
create another rc attached to the current iosrv<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;beginning on Hub 3 (the first
available):<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client io:)
remote 3<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;connect another client and switch to
that rc:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client) io
rc.2<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client io:)
attach 3<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;switch back to the original rc:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client io:)
attach 0<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;share an rc from the client machine back
to the iosrv:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (client io:) local
6<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;from inside a connected HOST machine
ioshell&nbsp; connect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; new&nbsp; rc<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hosted by the client:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (host io:) attach
6<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The above series of commands
demonstrates the basic principle of refer-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ring to multiple rc sessions within a
single iosrv is that the&nbsp; number-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ing proceeds by threes, because each rc
makes use of a set of the three<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;standard file descriptors, each of which
uses&nbsp; one&nbsp; Hub.&nbsp; Leaving&nbsp; Hubs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unused&nbsp; in&nbsp; between&nbsp; rc
trihub groupings is harmless apart from ineffi-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ciency, but overlapping multiple trihubs
within the same numeric group-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ing will produce results that are either
broken or awesomely nonconven-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tional depending on the user's
perspective.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Create an iosrv that allows you to
monitor dns requests:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io -c 'tail -f
/sys/log/dns' io.dns<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The following examples demonstrate some
of the internal control&nbsp; inter-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;face.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Start&nbsp; an&nbsp; iosrv&nbsp; with
verbose logging and a local control console, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;issue several commands to it:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io -i -v rc.3<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fear (set paranoid
mode)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; h1v (view info on
hub 1)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shutup (turn off
debugging-level output)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now connect a shell to the session with
no io&nbsp; delay&nbsp; and&nbsp; issue&nbsp; 'hub'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;commands to create a new set of usable
multiplexed io pipes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; io rc.3 fast
(since paranoid mode was set, use 'fast')<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h3s3 (start
new hub 3 with H3in3 as initial input)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h3o3 (add an
output file H3out3 from Hub 3)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h4s4<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h404
(similarly for Hub 4)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h5s5<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hub h5e5 (Hub 5
names output H5err5 for mnemonic)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now open a new window and connect a new
rc to the new hubs:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mount -c /srv/rc.3

BUGS<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not all flags are sane in combination.
The command parser is primitive.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not all user initiated control actions
are error checked. There are&nbsp; no<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;provided&nbsp; options&nbsp; for&nbsp;
giving clients different levels of privilege to<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;control the session. Mental incapacity
to grapple with the combinatoric<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;possibilities&nbsp; of
higher-dimensional pipe topologies (see below). Large<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;amount of client connections and
disconnections will produce many&nbsp; pro-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cesses&nbsp; that&nbsp; may need manual
pruning. Some of the semantics are ad-hoc<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and users should be provided with more
naming&nbsp; and&nbsp; numbering&nbsp; control.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reinvention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
wheel&nbsp; in octagonal form. Parameters such as data<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bucket size are compiled-in. The whole
thing should probably&nbsp; implement<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;itself as a 9p fs rather than
piggybacking on exportfs (4) and pipe (3)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;files.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Doug had for years and years, and he
talked to&nbsp; us&nbsp; continually&nbsp; about<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it,&nbsp; a&nbsp; notion&nbsp; of
interconnecting computers in grids, and arrays, very<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;complex, and there were always problems
in his proposals. That what you<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;would type would be linear and what he
wanted was three-dimensional, n-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dimensional...I mean he wanted just
topological connection of&nbsp; programs<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp; to&nbsp; build&nbsp;
programs&nbsp; with loops and and horrid things. He had such<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;grandiose ideas and we were saying,
the&nbsp; complexity&nbsp; you're&nbsp; generating<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;just&nbsp; can't&nbsp; be&nbsp;
fathomed.&nbsp; You don't sit down and you don't type these<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;kind of connections together. And he
persisted with the grandiose ideas<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;where you get into Kirchoff's law
problems...what happens if you have a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;feedback loop and every program doubles
the number&nbsp; of&nbsp; characters,&nbsp; it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reads&nbsp; one and writes two? It's got
to go somewhere - synchronization -<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there's just no way to implement his
ideas and we kept trying&nbsp; to&nbsp; pare<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;him&nbsp; down&nbsp; and&nbsp;
weed&nbsp; him down and get something useful and distill it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What was needed, was real ideas...and
there were&nbsp; constant&nbsp; discussions<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all&nbsp; through&nbsp; this&nbsp;
period, and it hit just one night, it just hit, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they went in instantly."<br>
